    <h2>About project</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This open source project is about momentum base trend following systematic trading strategies inspired from top trend following traders (Richard Denis, Olivier Seban and Nick Radge) implemented for various trading platforms as TradingView, cTrader, MetaTrader, Multicharts and TradeStation.    </p>
    <h3>What is trend-following trading?</h3>
    <p>
      Trend following is when you try to capture extended moves in the financial markets, either up or down, mostly for long-term gains. Once in a while prices tend to keep on going (enduring) and these are the moves trend followers like. The aim is to capture most of such moves, not all, but the majority of them.
    </p>
    <p>
Trend followers are not trying to predict tops and bottoms. They are not trying to predict anything, really. The aim is, quite simply, to take advantage of moves in different asset classes in the anticipation that some of the positions go their way big time. There is zero forecasting involved.

          The Turtle Trading strategy is a famous trend-following approach developed by legendary commodity traders Richard Dennis and William Eckhardt in the early 1980s.
          The strategy involves buying a stock or contract during a breakout (when prices move above a trading range) and quickly selling on a retracement or price fall.
