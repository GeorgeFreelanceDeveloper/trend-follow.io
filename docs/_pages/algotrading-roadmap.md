# Algotrading Roadmap
Algorithmic trading, or algotrading, refers to the use of computer programs and algorithms to execute trades in financial markets. These algorithms follow predefined rules to decide on the timing, price, or quantity of trades without the need for human intervention. The primary goal is to execute orders faster and more efficiently than manual trading.

## Intro into algotrading
Trading is the buying and selling of financial instruments in order to make a profit. These instruments range from a variety of assets that are assigned a financial value that can go up or down – and you can trade on the direction they’ll take.

You may have heard about stocks, shares and funds. But there are thousands of financial markets you can trade, and a variety of products you can use to trade them.

Key Features of Algorithmic Trading:

* **Speed and Automation**: Algorithms can process large amounts of data and execute trades at high speeds, often in milliseconds or microseconds.
* **Precision**: Algorithms follow exact instructions, minimizing the risk of human error in placing trades.
* **Backtesting**: Strategies can be tested on historical data to assess their potential effectiveness before being deployed in live markets.
* **Cost Efficiency**: By automating trades, traders can potentially reduce transaction costs and slippage (the difference between the expected and actual trade price).
* **Scalability**: Algotrading allows traders to manage complex trading strategies and execute multiple orders across different assets simultaneously.

Common Types of Algorithmic Trading Strategies:

* **Market Making**: Algorithms place buy and sell orders to profit from the bid-ask spread.

* **Arbitrage**: Identifying and exploiting price differences between different markets or assets.

* **Trend Following**: Algorithms follow price trends and execute trades based on moving averages, momentum, or other technical indicators.

* **Mean Reversion**: Based on the theory that asset prices will revert to their historical average over time, these algorithms look for overbought or oversold conditions.

* **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**: A subset of algotrading that involves executing a large number of trades at extremely high speeds, often in milliseconds.


Advantages:

* **Efficiency**: Algorithms can scan multiple markets and assets in real-time, making trading more efficient.
* **Emotionless Trading**: Removes the emotional component of trading decisions, which can lead to more consistent outcomes.
* **24/7 Operation**: Algorithms can operate continuously, taking advantage of opportunities around the clock.

Disadvantages:

* **Over-Reliance on Technology**: System failures, bugs, or network issues can disrupt trading.
* **Market Impact**: Large algorithmic trades can move markets if not properly managed.
* **Complexity**: Developing and maintaining effective algorithms requires significant technical expertise.

In short, algotrading combines finance with technology to automate trading strategies, aiming for speed, precision, and reduced costs in financial markets.

## Markets
Financial markets are platforms or systems where buyers and sellers interact to trade financial assets such as stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, and derivatives. These markets are crucial to the functioning of the economy as they facilitate the transfer of capital from savers (investors) to entities (businesses, governments) that need funding for productive activities, such as expanding operations or developing new projects.

### Stocks
A stock represents a share in the ownership of a company. When you own a stock, you own a small portion (or "share") of that company, making you a shareholder or stockholder. Stocks are also referred to as equities because they represent ownership (or equity) in a company.

## Trend follow algotrading strategies
Trend following is when you try to capture extended moves in the financial markets, either up or down, mostly for long-term gains. Once in a while prices tend to keep on going (enduring) and these are the moves trend followers like. The aim is to capture most of such moves, not all, but the majority of them.
