# Mean reversal strategy

## What is Mean Reversion in Trading?

Mean reversion in trading is a concept that refers to the assumption that asset prices and historical returns eventually will return to the long-term mean. This concept is rooted in the statistical phenomenon known as regression toward the mean. Traders who use this strategy typically look for opportunities to buy or sell assets when prices deviate significantly from their historical mean in anticipation of their eventual return to it.

The rationale behind the mean reversion theory is that over time, prices that are unusually high or low will tend to normalize to their average values. This normalization can be due to various factors, including changes in market sentiment, economic factors, or simply the random fluctuations that occur in markets.

For example, if a stock’s price has historically oscillated around $50 but suddenly spikes to $80 without any significant change in the company’s fundamentals, a mean reversion trader might see this as an opportunity to sell the stock, expecting the stock price to fall back to its historical norm. Conversely, if the stock drops to $20, the trader might buy it, anticipating a rise back to the $50 level.

And that’s the basic idea of using mean reversion strategies – looking for extreme changes in prices in an asset price with the assumption that prices tend to return to their average prices.

## The Mean Reversion Trading Strategy

Similar to what we’ve mentioned earlier, the mean reversion trading strategy is grounded in the statistical phenomenon that extreme movements in asset prices are likely to be followed by a counter-movement, bringing prices back to their average level over time. So, to effectively employ this strategy, traders must first establish what the ‘mean’ is for their chosen market and time frame.

Now, calculating the mean involves taking an average of the asset’s historical prices over a specific period. This can be done using various tools, such as a simple spreadsheet to calculate the average manually, a mean reversion indicator that automates the process, or by visually inspecting a chart to identify the average price level around which the price has tended to fluctuate.

Once the mean price is established, traders can then watch for significant deviations from this average. Day traders typically look for intraday price movements away from the mean to capitalize on quick reversals. In contrast, swing traders and long-term investors may seek out more pronounced price extremes that occur over days, weeks, or months, anticipating a more significant move back toward the mean.

## Why do stocks revert to mean?

One possible explanation why stocks revert to mean could be margin, or rather the lack of margin. Why would margin make the market mean revertive? As stocks go up and down they become more liable to rebalancing, and this means selling those stocks which have risen and buying those which have fallen.

Both hedge funds and mutual funds have mandates on how to operate, both on risk parameters and diversification. Thus, they are obligated to reshuffle their portfolio, which is often against the prevailing trend.

Another aspect is short selling and arbitrage. Short sellers short overvalued stocks and buy undervalued stocks, which effectively dampens both upside and downside moves. This also explains why we tend to see the most violent moves to the upside during bear markets: short-sellers run to the exits (they need to buy to cover their positions) and this adds fuel to the fire.

Likewise, arbitrageurs short those which rise in value and buy those which fall in value.
